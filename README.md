## General info
This is simple tool for engineers to quickly calculating the area moment of inertia and section modulus of geometric figures. 

Moment of inertia is important for determining the strength of beams and columns of a structural system. Moment of inertia is considered as resistance to bending and torsion of a structure. It is also required to find slope and deflection of beams.

## How to use the Moment of Inertia Calculator?
To start using the app to calculate moment of inertia, simply choose the cross section you want to evaluate from the drop down list, then enter in the dimensions and choose the unit from the second drop down list. Click calculate button. The results for moment of inertia and section modulus will display in table below.
